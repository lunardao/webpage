            <p><em><i>DarkFi is a not just a privacy oriented crypto project, but is building a wider range anonymous
                        ecosystem such as payments, swaps, DEX, NFTs as well as a communication (darkirc) and task
                        management tool (tau). DarkFi, thus far, has been also the only project developing an anonymous
                        DAO primitive.</i></em></p>
            <p><em><i>The lunarpunk narrative finds much of its origin from DarkFi. Since then, it has been widely
                        adopted and practiced by other people and projects. DAOs, with the power of crypto, have the
                        ability to execute community funding projects and governance anonymously. The purchase of a
                        DarkFi NFT for anon research & development makes it possible for anyone to contribute to DarkFi
                        development anonymously, and at the same time, directing funds to anon contributors. We breathe
                        life into a new LunarDAO, which by using Firn is taking essential steps toward a complete anon
                        DAO.</i></em></p>

            <h4>LunarDAO II</h4>
            <p>The latest LunarDAO Improvement Proposal <a
                    href="https://forum.lunardao.net/t/lip-0005-contribute-to-darkfi-research-and-development/216">LIP-0005</a>
                suggests the LunarDAO squad supports DarkFi R&D.</p>
            <p>Around the time of the next new moon, LunarDAO ventures further along towards a Lunarpunk Future. The DAO
                will initiate a raise for DarkFi to support its anon developers. A new anonymous DAO, LunarDAO II, will
                be summoned. This new squad will collectively own a 1:1 DarfkFi NFT.</p>
            <p>There have been different opinions on whether the initial DAO should participate in the the raise or not,
                and we decided to create a new one - LunarDAO II.<em> Everyone can join, regardless of being a member of
                    LunarDAO previously or not.</em></p>
            <p>All donors will receive governance tokens proportionate to their share of the Darkfi NFT, representing
                voting rights in LunarDAO II.</p>
            <p>If you are a member of the initial LunarDAO and you want to participate in LunarDAO II, please rage-quit,
                keep your FIRN and use your ETH according to the guide.</p>

            <div class="numbered-list">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Bridge your ETH to Arbitrum.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Deposit funds to <a href="https://firn.io/">Firn</a> to anonymize your assets on the Arbitrum chain</strong>.
                        To
                        maximise
                        anonymity it's recommended that you deposit a greater amount to Firn than you plan to use for
                        the
                        raise. It's also recommended that you make this deposit as early as possible to mitigate value &
                        time correlation risks. </li>
                    <li><strong>Create a new Ethereum account other than the original Ethereum address used to deposit into Firn</strong> this will be your

            <p>Just like the initial round of LunarDAO, part two will have permissionless entry with the same Moloch v3
                governance model, using a second iteration of our squad token VOX2.</p>

                <li>Maximum cap: 2 weeks or 161 ETH (according to LIP-0005 the cap is $500k, 161 ETH is representation)

            <h4>Detailed steps to follow</h4>
            <h5>1. Bridging to Arbitrum</h5>
            <p>Bridge assets from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum via <a
                    href="https://bridge.arbitrum.io">bridge.arbitrum.io</a>
                (Note: there is a scam page that has the same header, but an incorrect url. Make sure to verify the
                links.
                That
                includes links provided by this wiki). This is a guide on <a
                    href="https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbitrum-bridge/quickstart">how to use Arbitrum
                    bridge</a>. </p>
            <h5>2. Firn usage</h5>
            <p>After bridging assets to Arbitrum, it's time to deposit funds to Firn. In order to maximize anonymity
                deposit
                multiples of 0.1 ETH, such as 0.1, 0.5, 1 ETH and so on. To maximise anonymity it's recommended that you
                deposit
                a greater amount to Firn than you plan to use for the NFT investment. Make sure to deposit as early as
                possible
                to mitigate value & time correlation risks. Here is a guide on <a
                    href="https://docs.firn.io/overview/using-firn">how to use Firn</a>. </p>
            <p><em><i>Deposited funds on Firn.io may be withdrawn at any time - depositing into Firn itself does *not*
                        bond
                        a
                        user to participiate in this raise.</i></em></p>
            <h5>3. Setting up Metamask wallet</h5>
            <p>Follow <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/fiat_to_crypto.html#set-up-a-metamask-wallet">this guide</a>
                for
                how to
                set up a
                new Metamask wallet.</p>
            <p>The best option is to use Tor browser to set up a Metamask wallet as Tor browser also protects user IP
                address.
                To set up more than one wallet, the add-on needs to be removed after the first wallet setup is complete
                then
                click on the 'cleaning brush' icon in the upper right corner to change identity. </p>
            <p>A - If using another browser ensure that you are using a VPN to protect your IP address and not doxx
                yourself.
                Here are some examples of VPNs: <a href="https://lokinet.org/">Lokinet</a>, <a
                    href="https://geph.io/en">Geph</a>)
                or <a href="https://protonvpn.com/download">ProtonVPN</a>. ProtonVPN should be used with 'secure core'
                or
                'tor'
                when
                connecting to the VPN, to enable two hops (which is only available on the paid version).</p>
            <p>B - <a href="https://wallet.brume.money/">Brume Wallet</a>" is another option for an Ethereum wallet with
                built-in
                Tor by default.</p>
            <p>For more information on how to anonymize assets on Ethereum, read <a
                    href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/anonymizing_assets.html#anonymize-assets-using-eth">this
                    guide</a>.
            </p>
            <h5>4. Buy a share of DarkFi NFT</h5>
            <p>During a designated time period, anyone can purchase a share of DarkFi NFT via the
                <a href="https://donate.firn.io">donate.firn.io</a> custom donation page.
            </p>
