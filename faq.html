<p class="question" id="1">Can I contribute to the DAO anonymously?</p>
<br>
<p class="answer">Yes. It is recommended. Follow this <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/anonymizing_assets.html">guide</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p class="question" id="2">Does it matter whether I'm anonymous or not?</p>
<br>
<p class="answer">LunarDAO is focused on privacy-preserving projects. This ethos permeates how you should participate in the DAO. Privacy techniques are strongly encouraged when interacting with the DAO.
  <br>
Each piece of information that a user gives up degrades their privacy. Achieving anonymity on a transparent chain is extremely difficult.
  <br>
Privacy degradation stems from:
  <br>
</p>

<ul class="answer">
  <li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> Doxxed addresses</li>
  <li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> Network leaks</li>
  <li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> Side channel attacks</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p class="answer">LunarDAO participants should solve for all of these threats.</p>

<hr>

<p class="question" id="3">I have nothing to hide.</p>
<br>
<p class="answer">“Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.”<br>
&mdash; Edward Snowden
</p>

<hr>

<p class="question" id="4">How do I apply for funding from LunarDAO?</p>
<br>
<p class="answer">A LunarDAO Squad member is every community member with $100 VOX or more (calculated in 7 days staking ratio). Any proposal within LunarDAO; standard or investment is done via LIP (LunarDAO Improvement Proposal). This includes any project who want to apply for grants from LunarDAO. Squad members are eligable to submit a LIP. Read more in <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/grant_application.html">grant application</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p class="question" id="5">What is LunarDAO?</p>
<br>
<p class="answer">The moon symbolizes many things, including transformation, life, strength and power. Life itself means continuous transformation. Life that is stagnant, that conforms, will cease to exist.
	<br>
Lunarpunk is the emergence of a great forest that is continually expanding against surveillance society. LunarDAO is a part of this forest. It was born out of necessity. The shifting tides of regulation have forced us to focus on improving our defenses.
	<br>
We constituted LunarDAO because we believe in community, decentralization, individual responsibility and contribution to a common mission. LunarDAO is a community directed by Lunar Squad. It is a practical application of the lunarpunk vision.</p>

<hr>

<p class="question" id="6">What are the aims of LunarDAO?</p>
<br>
<p class="answer">These are the aims of LunarDAO:<br></p>

	<ul class="answer">
	  <li><span class="bullet">1.</span> Enable parallel confederated societies that are diverse and autonomous but mutually protect each other against central authority.<br></li>
	  <li><span class="bullet">2.</span> Learn, educate, share knowledge. Education is fundamental in our struggle for free life, autonomy, and community.<br></li>
	  <li><span class="bullet">3.</span> Develop infrastructure for economy and politics beyond the state, that is uncensorable, sovereign and anonymous. Expand the dark forest.</li>
	</ul>

<hr>

<p class="question" id="7">How can I join?</p>
<br>
<p class="answer">Anyone can become a part of LunarDAO Community by acquiring LUNAR. This does not give voting rights, but can participate in community discussions and contribute to the development of the DAO. Read more about <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/governance.html">governance</a> to know the structure and focus of the DAO and how you can join LunarDAO Squad to be able to sumbit LIP (LunarDAO Improvement Proposal) and participate in voting.</p>

<hr>

<p class="question" id="8">How are decisions made in LunarDAO?</p>
<br>
<p class="answer">Proposals concerning changes in governance, guidelines, as well as investment and fundraising are made through the LIP process. There is a template in <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/lip-0001.html">LIP-0001</a>. Voting is done through Snapshot.<br></p>
<p class="answer">However, LunarDAO governance is not limited to LIPs or Snapshot voting. Decisions flow upward from the community. Voting in LunarDAO is the practical implementation of the willpower of the community. The decision making process is not something technical and cannot be separated from our communication and interaction on the forum.<br></p>
<p class="answer">LunarDAO values discussion and diversity of opinions. We believe this will aid the development of a truly decentralized, anonymous and antifragile organization.</p>

<p class="question" id="9">What is LUNAR & VOX?</p>
<br>
<p class="answer">LunarDAO governance tokens:<br></p>

<div class="nfo-faq">
	<h2>LUNAR</h2>
<ul class="answer">
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> Everyone who holds $LUNAR is a part of LunarDAO Community<br></li>
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> You can stake $LUNAR to acquire $VOX, the LunarDAO governance token<br></li>
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> Through staking $LUNAR you can provide liquidity and earn rewards. Read more about Lunar staking <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/lunar_staking.html">here</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="nfo-faq">
	<h2>VOX</h2>
<ul class="answer">
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> $VOX is LunarDAO's governance token<br></li>
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> You can only acquire it by staking $LUNAR<br></li>
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> $VOX is burned when $LUNAR is unstaked</li>
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> If you have $100 worth of VOX (calculated in 7 days staking ratio) you are a LunarDAO Squad member and can submit LIP's and vote.</li>

<!-- <p class="question" id="10">How do I buy tokens?</p>
<br>
<p class="answer">LunarDAO runs a Protocol Owned Liquidity which serves as a pool for trading $LUNAR <a href="">here</a>.</p> -->

<!-- <hr> -->

<p class="question" id="11">How does staking work?</p>
<br>
<ul class="answer">
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> 50% of all $LUNAR emission are allocated as staking rewards. Those are every 24h divided between all staked LUNAR tokens (their holders proportionally).<br></li>
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> Non-vested staking pool allows for $LUNAR holders to stake and unstake at anytime and earn the given APR.<br></li>
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> Locked Staking Pools: receive $VOX and a higher APR. $LUNAR tokens can be locked in pools from 7 days to 2 years.<br></li>
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> The longer period of staking, the more $VOX is received, and the higher the APR ratio. Locking $LUNAR decreased the amount of $LUNAR in circulation and increases the price.</li>
</ul>

<p class="question"id="12">What are the committees?</p>
<br>
<p class="answer">Committees in LunarDAO are sub-groups within the community that aim to facilitate specific tasks needed by the DAO.<br>The committees presented below are considered fundamental to the DAO.<br></p>

<ul class="answer">
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> <span style="color:#A5A5D9">Stewards</span> guides the foundational works of the DAO, and among other things coordinate operations and project investment, make sure everyone knows about voting and implement decisions. Initially Stewards include founding members.<br></li>
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> <span style="color:#A5A5D9">Media committee</span> is responsible to update the web page, twitter, and mdbook, coordinate and intiate media works according to needs and LunarDAO aims.<br></li>
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> <span style="color:#A5A5D9">Research committee</span> conduct research about privacy project which can serve as a basis for LIP to support projects, and as a resource for the community.<br></li>
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> <span style="color:#A5A5D9">Education committee</span> coordinate the support of educational projects with aim to share knowledge and skills in a decentralized way. New Moon Academy will be in the forefront of this work, with online educations in programming, economics and political philosophy.<br></li>
	<li><span class="bullet">&#10023;</span> <span style="color:#A5A5D9">Sentinels</span> a group of six multi-sig. Four is needed to execute Lunar Squad decisions. Sentinels also have the possibility to reject malicious proposals.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p class="answer">At any point new committees can be proposed or existing ones can be archived should the community deem this necessary (through LIP and voting). The committee autonomously decides who can join. In every committee there is one person responsible for communication, who can be contacted if a member want to get involved.<br></p>

<p class="answer">The committee decides its own work flow and formulates the goals of the committee. All committees give information about their tasks in LunarDAO community meetings and are receptive to input and criticisms. Every three months each committee will sumbit a report to the community detailing what has been done. The community evaluates the work of a committee every 12 months.<br></p>
