<h2 class="manifesto-title">Roadmap</h2>

<hr>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>LunarDAO is a new-born squad aiming to become a powerful community. We are taking the first steps and received important feedback.

<p>Exemplary in this sense has been the first Tokenomics publication and the discussion it created among the initial Squad (lunarpunk allies, friends and collaborators). We're working hard to make sure that  this is a project for the community and not imposed from the above by a core team of founders. Here's <a href="https://github.com/lunardao/dao">LunarDAO architecture V2</a> and the <a href="https://forum.lunardao.net/t/tokenomics-lunar-vox/89/25?u=ogma">community discussion</a> about it.
Working anonymously has been a challenge. However, we explain the decision in this <a href="https://lunardao.net/why-anon.html">article</a>.

<p>We appreciate the invaluable input from everyone and hope that we will continue to have this exchange and development together through shared <a href="https://github.com/lunardao/okr/blob/master/okrs_february_23.md">Objectives & Key Results</a> discussed with the <a href="https://lunardao.net/community.html">community</a>.

<p>LunarDAO invests in privacy & anonymity tooling. By leveraging collective strength, the DAO builds squad wealth to support builders and developers. Through investment, we build a portfolio of privacy assets. This is how LunarDAO captures value in the ecosystem.</p>

<hr>

<h4>MAIN PRIMITIVES</h4>

<p>There are three main primitives included in the roadmap to build anti-fragile & incentive-aligned lunarpunk squad wealth. Not all the primitives are meant to be built by the DAO itself, but instead we aim to research, discuss, vote and invest into existing initiatives.</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/lunardao/dao">Investment DAO</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://forum.lunardao.net/t/saft-nft-discussion/119/8">On-Chain Agreements</a></li>
	<li>AnonDAO</li>
</ol>

<h5>INVESTMENT DAO</h5>

<p>The main priority is to achieve the mission with a solid <a href="https://github.com/lunardao/dao">tokenomics & governance structure</a>. This structure will be robust, aligned with the objectives and fairly simple to understand. Leveraging collective power while protecting individuals against the tyranny of majority. Tested designs with agreed adjustments are preferred over experimentational or overly complex models.</p>

<p>There have been many question and points of consideration beyond the scope of this introduction. We welcome everyone to build this primitive with us. Join the <a href="https://forum.lunardao.net/t/tokenomics-lunar-vox/89">forum</a> and discuss with others in the community.</p>

<h5>ON-CHAIN AGREEMENTS</h5>

<p>Investment in other projects and development teams requires a contract to ensure both counterparties, LunarDAO Squad (the investing community) and the supported project, follow the investment agreement without state based/legal structures involved. Such research and development needs a collaboration between LunarDAO Squad, the <a href="https://twitter.com/lunarpunksquad/status/1616859865024188419">Research committee</a>, Web3 developers and lawyers.</p>

<p>The proposal is to create a template of a SAFT NFT. Such contract would contain all the points mentioned in <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/raise_investment.html">investment & raise</a> <i>(These points are illustrative and can change as the tokenomics are under construction)</i>.</p>

<p>This SAFT needs to have a built-in tool to enforce the token allocation, which means that at the agreed upon time or trigger event, the promised tokens will be automatically transferred to the DAO treasury (investors' shares). It is an essential piece in order to build a solid incentive system beyond regulations of different and undesirable jurisdictions.</p>

<h5>ANONDAO</h5>

<p>LunarDAO Stewards (core team) explained in detail the philosophy, choices and trade-offs behind remaining <a href="https://lunardao.net/why-anon.html">anonymous</a> and the [contradiction in starting on <a href="https://twitter.com/lunarpunksquad/status/1607437167772504064">Ethereum</a>. At the time of writing the AnonDAO primitive does not exist on any mainnet and we have decided to start to gather energy and allocate resources to support the development of such vital milestone.</p>

<p>Our proposal is to invest in an AnonDAO and, once it has been tested and established, a migration of LunarDAO (ETH) to Anon-LunarDAO congruently.</p>

<p><a href="https://dark.fi">DarkFi</a> presented AnonDAO primitive at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKVVQWiaLFQ">#hcpp22</a> and recently published a <a href="https://dark.fi/insights/testnet-v1a.html">testnet release</a> of their full anon L1. This seems to be one of the most interesting options to keep track of at the moment. We will begin discussing possible collborations on this primitive.</p>

<p>Research into teams developing the AnonDAO foundation and implementation of such migration, token bridges, community discussions, testing and voting are needed to progress in light of the search for creating a fully anonymous DAO.</p>

<h4>BUILDING TOGETHER</h4>

<p>None of the milestones are set for an eternity! Any feedback from the community is more than welcome and we're open to constructive criticism: this DAO is a tool to organize and manage ourselves as a squad.</p>

<p>Freedom will not happen by its own volition, and the needed infrastructure for sovereignty and privacy is in our hands to make a reality. Together we are anti-fragile, creative and persistent. To go lunarpunk is a decision, a commitment and a practice - to regain agency in our own lives.</p>

<hr>

<h4>QUALITY OVER SPEED</h4>

<img src="img/support_ld.png" alt="Support Us" style="margin-bottom:70px; border:1px solid #5F5F92"/>

<p>Laying down the foundation of the DAO has been an ongoing work for several months, which included being responsive to feedback and rethinking outputs based on this. There are six <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/governance.html#stewards">Stewards/core-team members</a>, a number which also includes Media committee as well as the initial <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/intro.html">research done</a> before the <a href="https://twitter.com/lunarpunksquad/status/1616859865024188419">Research committee</a> was established. The core-team is enforced by several externals supporting with design, administration, legal questions, web3 development and <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/manifesto_tc.html">translations</a>.</p>

<p>We have decided NOT to open any private presale, neither VC rounds nor ask for any grants. Based on the community decision LunarDAO tabled the first tokenomics design/contracts and halted the planned Genesis token sale. Now we are building the <a href="https://github.com/lunardao/dao">architecture v2</a> better aligned with the objectives. We stick to the plan and believe that the re-doing of the fundamentals is for the quality of LunarDAO <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/manifesto.html">mission</a>.</p>

<h4>Accepting Donations</h4>

<p>LunarDAO Stewards were <a href="https://forum.lunardao.net/t/tokenomics-lunar-vox/89/18?u=ogma">proposed</a> to accept donations in order to take more time for the needed development. The proposal was agreed upon in the <a href="https://twitter.com/lunarpunksquad/status/1615001037949075456">ircd community meeting</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to support the ongoing works, building the primitives and the development leading towards the launch, we &ndash; the Stewards (core-team/founders) of LunarDAO accept donations to our shared multi-sig wallet:</p>
