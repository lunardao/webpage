<p>Edits: The article has been updated (Feb 28th, 2023). One core-team member stepped out of the treasury multisig in exchange for <a href="https://twitter.com/polarpunklabs">@polarpunklabs</a> in order to further decentralize the treasury responsibility. See 'Sentinel committee'.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second update (April 16th, 2023). <a href="https://twitter.com/polarpunklabs">@polarpunklabs</a> was exchanged by <a href="https://twitter.com/yvesedwards">@yvesedwards</a> and the address of the treasury was exchanged as the multi-sig and treasury are two different contracts.</p>

<p>LunarDAO has finalized the multi-sig. The DAO is supported by privacy partisans who, through their everyday research, development and usage of essential privacy projects and tools are a part of realizing the lunarpunk imaginary. It is an honor that these allies are taking on this important responsibility. In total, the Sentinels are eight people. Two of them include DAO core members. Five are needed to execute a squad decision — this means that the execution of decisions can be done without core members. The multi-sig treasury address is <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x622066aba170c185c28ced6e7ccd1cb2047ef6ef">lunarpunksquad.eth</a></p>

<h2>LunarDAO's Allies: Supporting the Mission Within a Broader Movement</h2>
<p><em><a href="https://github.com/lunardao/dao">Governance and tokenomics</a> of LunarDAO are currently being discussed on our <a href="https://forum.lunardao.net">forum</a> and the style in which LunarDAO Squad protects its treasury may change. The finalization of the Sentinel committee (the treasury 5/8 multi-sig) is based on the current <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/governance.html">setup</a>. Join the <a href="https://forum.lunardao.net/t/tokenomics-lunar-vox/89/25?u=ogma">discussion</a> and support the development of the <a href="https://github.com/lunardao/dao">DAO architecture</a>.</em></p>
<p>Builders and teams in our ecosystem of privacy oriented projects are often public, or use known pseudonyms, and are recognized in crypto communities. In <a href="https://lunardao.net/why-anon.html">Why anon</a> we explained why anonymity and privacy are not only important for lunarpunk movement, but also the only choice for the <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/governance.html#stewards">Stewards</a> (core team/ founders) of LunarDAO.</p>
<p>We shared the downsides of anonymity — that we can't build on previous accomplishments or reputation. Why would the community trust us without knowing who we are? In this field it is a very relevant question as there have been many scammers taking advantage of people's trust.</p>
<p>To build this trust, the DAO is collaborating with people who are in the forefront of promoting the lunarpunk narrative along with qualitative privacy-focused research. These people develop and use privacy tools, and are well respected within this movement. They are not Stewards, but are allies that support the DAO mission within a broader movement.</p>
<p>Recently, we've introduced the <a href="https://twitter.com/lunarpunksquad/status/1616859865024188419">Research Committee</a> and a first hint of <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/anoma.html">their work</a>. Now we are prepared to present the <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/governance.html#sentinels">Sentinels</a> (the treasury multi-sig) who have agreed to manage the DAO treasury in good faith.</p>

<h2>Sentinel Committee</h2>
<p>The Sentinel Committee are the guardians of the treasury. In total, it's composed of eight people of which five are needed to execute a transaction or protocol changes. Let's introduce them.</p>

<h2>Treasury Execution Without Core</h2>
<p>The remaining two Sentinels are anonymous Stewards. We aim to reduce the centralization of the treasury by minimizing the presence of Stewards in the treasury multi-sig while still being able to faciliate the responsibility and necessary communications.</p>
<p>For Sentinels to be able to execute a squad decision, five are needed to confirm the transaction. Therefore, the treasury can execute without the two core team members on the treasury wallet.</p>
<h2>Malicious Proposal Rejection</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the role of the multi-sig is to carry out the will of the LunarDAO Squad — which is made up of both the community and core. Since the multi-sig also has the ability to reject malicious proposals, this distribution is vital. You can find the criterias for rejection in the <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/governance.html">governance</a> doc.</p>
<p>The possibility to reject a malicious proposal protects the LunarDAO treasury and ensures the ability to continue to invest in projects and build the lunarpunk vision.</p>
<h2>Treasury Multi-Sig Sentinel Duration</h2>
<p>The suggested time frame to be a multi-sig participant is two years, which is not intended as a rigid measurement but as a way to show continuity and responsibility. The transfer will happen when there is someone who can take over when the time is due. To rotate responsibilities to new Sentinels supports a level of diversity of thought in this important governance responsibility.</p>
<p>We welcome any feedback from the community. Come join the Squad and build <a href="https://lunardao.net/community.html">LunarDAO</a> with us!</p>
