      <p>The LunarDAO Improvement Proposal (<a
          href="https://forum.lunardao.net/t/lip-0005-contribute-to-darkfi-research-and-development/216">LIP-0005</a>)
        suggests the LunarDAO squad supports DarkFi research &amp; development.</p>
      <p>Around the time of the next full moon, LunarDAO ventures further along to a Lunarpunk Future. The DAO will
        initiate a raise for DarkFi to support its anon developers. An anonymous sub-DAO will be summoned that will
        collectively own a 1/1 DarkFi NFT.</p>
      <p>Anyone can participate in the raise and all donors will receive tokens proportionate to their share of the
        Darkfi NFT, representing voting rights in the new sub-DAO.</p>
        <hr>
      <h4>DAO Membership &amp; Raise Logic</h4>
      <p><strong>The donation phase will open soon, keep your eyes open and <a
            href="https://lunardao.net/community.html">follow our channels!</a></strong></p>
      <p>LunarDAO decided to create a new DAO - LunarDAOII. Everyone can join, regardless of being a previous member of
        LunarDAO or not, as long as new members allocate at least 0.01 ETH within the raise period.</p>
      <ul class="square-list">
        <li>Before the raise an escrow smart contract is created which has locked the 1/1 NFT, transferring the NFT once
          the raised is closed and the raised amount in Firn has been transferred to the address specified by DarkFi.
        </li>
        <li>LunarDAOII is on Arbitrum chain.</li>
        <li>Participants who already deposited to Firn can join from Firn donation page made especially for this raise.
          It'is also possible to join the raise directly by joining LunarDAO II.</li>
        <li>Every participant gets shares - governance token VOX2 - in proportion to their donation.</li>
        <li>The raise will take 15 days - aim is $500k worth of ETH.</li>
        <li>During the raise no proposals can be submitted and shares are non-transferable.</li>
        <li>Finally, LunarDAOII will be created by sending funds to the escrow and receiving the 1/1 NFT from Darkfi
          (the Escrow), governed collectively by the holders of VOX2 tokens.</li>
        <li>LunarDAOII is also based on Moloch3 - read our <a
            href="https://github.com/lunardao/dao/blob/master/README.md">updated whitepaper</a> explaining the <a
            href="https://github.com/lunardao/dao/blob/master/README.md#governance-process">governance process</a>.</li>
        <li>Initial LunarDAOII parameters are listed <a
            href="https://github.com/lunardao/dao/blob/master/README.md#the-dao">here</a> - All of those are a
          adjustable by LunarDAOII governance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Information above is a subject to change, please follow the LunarDAO <a
            href="https://lunardao.net/community.html">public channels</a> for specific dates and access.</strong></p>

      <h4>How to Join</h4>
      <p>There are two ways to join the DarkFi raise.</p>
      <h5>A) Join the raise via Firn</h5>
      <p><strong>NOTE: This is only for those who already deposited funds in Firn on Arbitrum. <a
            href="https://lunardao.net/firn_statement.html">Firn closed further deposits</a>, withdrawals are
          open.</strong></p>
      <p>1) <strong>Locally create a new Ethereum account in your wallet, and access the donation site on <a
            href="https://donate.firn.io">donate.firn.io</a></strong> - This link will become active when the raise
        starts.</p>
      <p>2) <strong>Buy a share of DarkFi NFT &amp; provide your new ETH address.</strong> Connect to Firn and allocate
        a portion of the anonymized funds, pointing to the new address as receiver of shares. Don't forget to send some
        ETH-ARB from Firn to that address as well for governance fees.</p>
      <p>3) <strong>As the raise period ends, the NFT transfer takes place and the sub-DAO tokens will be minted to the
          address you provided</strong> The token ownership will grant you a proportion of governance over the NFT in
        LunarDAO II.</p>
      <ul class="square-list">
        <li>If you are already waiting within the firn pool, you can still participate using the <a
            href="https://donate.firn.io">Firn donation portal</a></li>
        <li>If you use Firn, do not come from a multi-sig arbitrum address. This should be a single-sig address that is
          also accessible from the Ethereum main chain.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>B) Join the raise without directly</h5>
      <p>1) <strong>Move ETH to Arbitrum</strong></p>
      <p>2) <strong>Join LunarDAO II by offering a minimum tribute of 0.01 ETH (address will be shared on
          launch)</strong> In return, you'll receive governance tokens in the DAO, and when the raise is completed, also
        a share of the NFT. The raise will be open for two weeks and the goal is to raise %500k.</p>
      <p>3) <strong>As the raise period ends, the NFT transfer takes place and the sub-DAO tokens will be minted to the
          address you used for the donation</strong> The token ownership will grant you a proportion of governance over
        the NFT in LunarDAO II.</p>

      <h4>Setting up Ethereum wallet</h4>
      <p>Follow <a href="https://wiki.lunardao.net/fiat_to_crypto.html#set-up-a-metamask-wallet">this guide</a> for how
        to set up a new Metamask wallet.</p>
      <p>The best option for setting up a new Metamask wallet is to use Tor browser as it also protects user IP address.
        To set up more than one wallet, the add-on needs to be removed after the first wallet setup is complete then
        click on the 'cleaning brush' icon in the upper right corner to change identity.</p>
        <h5><strong>NOTE</strong></h5>
      <p>A) If using another browser ensure that you are using a VPN to protect your IP address and not doxx yourself.
        Here are some examples of VPNs: <a href="https://lokinet.org/">Lokinet</a>, <a
          href="https://geph.io/en">Geph</a> or <a href="https://protonvpn.com/download">ProtonVPN</a>.
        ProtonVPN should be used with 'secure core' or 'tor' when connecting to the VPN, to enable two hops (which is
        only available on the paid version).</p>
        <p>B) <a href="https://wallet.brume.money/">Brume Wallet</a> is another option for an Ethereum wallet with built-in
        Tor by default.</p>
